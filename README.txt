Oddjob project is based on the Photoduino project.
My main objective is to add a new interface to this project, I have added a touch screen with several updated.

Logos are stored on the SD card, UTFT library and tools are used to generate logo.

You have to copy logos on RAW format into the root of your SD card.

To do list:
-unbug the display: some case the text is too long and wrote out of display memory, I have to fix this issue

-The date and time module is not coded to log all information with date and time
-luxmeter display information but information is display without presentation.

I publish more information on the www.godreau.fr website with photos.
